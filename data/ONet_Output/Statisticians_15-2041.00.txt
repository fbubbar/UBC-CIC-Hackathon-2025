# DESCRIPTION
Develop or apply mathematical or statistical theory and methods to collect, organize, interpret, and summarize numerical data to provide usable information. May specialize in fields such as biostatistics, agricultural statistics, business statistics, or economic statistics. Includes mathematical and survey statisticians.

# TASKS
- Analyze and interpret statistical data to identify significant differences in relationships among sources of information.
- Evaluate the statistical methods and procedures used to obtain data to ensure validity, applicability, efficiency, and accuracy.
- Report results of statistical analyses, including information in the form of graphs, charts, and tables.
- Determine whether statistical methods are appropriate, based on user needs or research questions of interest.
- Prepare data for processing by organizing information, checking for inaccuracies, and adjusting and weighting the raw data.
- Develop and test experimental designs, sampling techniques, and analytical methods.
- Identify relationships and trends in data, as well as any factors that could affect the results of research.
- Present statistical and nonstatistical results, using charts, bullets, and graphs, in meetings or conferences to audiences such as clients, peers, and students.
- Design research projects that apply valid scientific techniques, and use information obtained from baselines or historical data to structure uncompromised and efficient analyses.
- Adapt statistical methods to solve specific problems in many fields, such as economics, biology, and engineering.
- Evaluate sources of information to determine any limitations, in terms of reliability or usability.
- Process large amounts of data for statistical modeling and graphic analysis, using computers.
- Develop software applications or programming for statistical modeling and graphic analysis.
- Report results of statistical analyses in peer-reviewed papers and technical manuals.
- Plan data collection methods for specific projects, and determine the types and sizes of sample groups to be used.
- Apply sampling techniques, or use complete enumeration bases to determine and define groups to be surveyed.
