# TASKS
- Embed tissue specimens into paraffin wax blocks, or infiltrate tissue specimens with wax.
- Cut sections of body tissues for microscopic examination, using microtomes.
- Stain tissue specimens with dyes or other chemicals to make cell details visible under microscopes.
- Compile materials for distribution to pathologists, such as surgical working drafts, requisitions, and slides.
- Compile and maintain records of preventive maintenance and instrument performance checks according to schedule and regulations.
- Perform tests by following physician instructions.
- Operate computerized laboratory equipment to dehydrate, decalcify, or microincinerate tissue samples.
- Prepare substances, such as reagents and dilution, and stains for histological specimens according to protocols.
- Resolve problems with laboratory equipment and instruments, such as microscopes, mass spectrometers, microtomes, immunostainers, tissue processors, embedding centers, and water baths.
- Examine slides under microscopes to ensure tissue preparation meets laboratory requirements.
- Prepare or use prepared tissue specimens for teaching, research or diagnostic purposes.
- Perform procedures associated with histochemistry to prepare specimens for immunofluorescence or microscopy.
- Identify tissue structures or cell components to be used in the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases.
- Supervise histology laboratory activities.
- Teach students or other staff.
- Perform electron microscopy or mass spectrometry to analyze specimens.
