Job Title: Timing Device Assemblers and Adjusters
O*NET-SOC Code: 51-2061.00

# DESCRIPTION
Perform precision assembling or adjusting, within narrow tolerances, of timing devices such as digital clocks or timing devices with electrical or electronic components.

# TASKS
- Assemble and install components of timepieces to complete mechanisms, using watchmakers' tools and loupes.
- Observe operation of timepiece parts and subassemblies to determine accuracy of movement, and to diagnose causes of defects.
- Test operation and fit of timepiece parts and subassemblies, using electronic testing equipment, tweezers, watchmakers' tools, and loupes.
- Replace specified parts to repair malfunctioning timepieces, using watchmakers' tools, loupes, and holding fixtures.
- Disassemble timepieces such as watches, clocks, and chronometers so that repairs can be made.
- Clean and lubricate timepiece parts and assemblies, using solvents, buff sticks, and oil.
- Examine components of timepieces such as watches, clocks, or chronometers for defects, using loupes or microscopes.
- Bend parts, such as hairsprings, pallets, barrel covers, and bridges, to correct deficiencies in truing or endshake, using tweezers.
- Change timing weights on balance wheels to correct deficient timing.
- Adjust sizes or positioning of timepiece parts to achieve specified fit or function, using calipers, fixtures, and loupes.
- Mount hairsprings and balance wheel assemblies between jaws of truing calipers.
- Estimate spaces between collets and first inner coils to determine if spaces are within acceptable limits.
- Bend inner coils of springs away from or toward collets, using tweezers, to locate centers of collets in centers of springs, and to correct errors resulting from faulty colleting of coils.
- Turn wheels of calipers and examine springs, using loupes, to determine if center coils appear as perfect circles.
- Examine and adjust hairspring assemblies to ensure horizontal and circular alignment of hairsprings, using calipers, loupes, and watchmakers' tools.
- Review blueprints, sketches, or work orders to gather information about tasks to be completed.
- Tighten or replace loose jewels, using watchmakers' tools.
