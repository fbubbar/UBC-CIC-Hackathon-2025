O*NET-SOC Code: 51-4023.00

# DESCRIPTION
Set up, operate, or tend machines to roll steel or plastic forming bends, beads, knurls, rolls, or plate, or to flatten, temper, or reduce gauge of material.

# TASKS
- Monitor machine cycles and mill operation to detect jamming and to ensure that products conform to specifications.
- Adjust and correct machine set-ups to reduce thicknesses, reshape products, and eliminate product defects.
- Start operation of rolling and milling machines to flatten, temper, form, and reduce sheet metal sections and to produce steel strips.
- Examine, inspect, and measure raw materials and finished products to verify conformance to specifications.
- Read rolling orders, blueprints, and mill schedules to determine setup specifications, work sequences, product dimensions, and installation procedures.
- Manipulate controls and observe dial indicators to monitor, adjust, and regulate speeds of machine mechanisms.
- Set distance points between rolls, guides, meters, and stops, according to specifications.
- Calculate draft space and roll speed for each mill stand to plan rolling sequences and specified dimensions and tempers.
- Install equipment such as guides, guards, gears, cooling equipment, and rolls, using hand tools.
- Position, align, and secure arbors, spindles, coils, mandrels, dies, and slitting knives.
- Fill oil cups, adjust valves, and observe gauges to control flow of metal coolants and lubricants onto workpieces.
- Activate shears and grinders to trim workpieces.
- Signal and assist other workers to remove and position equipment, fill hoppers, and feed materials into machines.
- Record mill production on schedule sheets.
- Direct and train other workers to change rolls, operate mill equipment, remove coils and cobbles, and band and load material.
- Thread or feed sheets or rods through rolling mechanisms, or start and control mechanisms that automatically feed steel into rollers.
- Select rolls, dies, roll stands, and chucks from data charts to form specified contours and to fabricate products.
- Remove scratches and polish roll surfaces, using polishing stones and electric buffers.
- Disassemble sizing mills removed from rolling lines, and sort and store parts.
