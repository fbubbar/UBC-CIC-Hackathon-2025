- Perform chemical analyses of the microorganism content of soils to determine microbial reactions or chemical mineralogical relationships to plant growth.
- Develop ways of altering soils to suit different types of plants.
- Conduct experiments investigating how soil forms, changes, or interacts with land-based ecosystems or living organisms.
- Survey undisturbed or disturbed lands for classification, inventory, mapping, environmental impact assessments, environmental protection planning, conservation planning, or reclamation planning.
- Plan or supervise waste management programs for composting or farming.
- Research technical requirements or environmental impacts of urban green spaces, such as green roof installations.
