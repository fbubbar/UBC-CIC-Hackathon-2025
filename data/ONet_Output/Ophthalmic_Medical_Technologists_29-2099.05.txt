- Administer topical ophthalmic or oral medications.
- Measure and record lens power, using lensometers.
- Calculate corrections for refractive errors.
- Collect ophthalmic measurements or other diagnostic information, using ultrasound equipment, such as A-scan ultrasound biometry or B-scan ultrasonography equipment.
- Perform ophthalmic triage, in the office or by phone, to assess severity of patients' conditions.
- Clean or sterilize ophthalmic or surgical instruments.
- Educate patients on ophthalmic medical procedures, conditions of the eye, and appropriate use of medications.
- Conduct ocular motility tests to measure function of eye muscles.
- Assess refractive condition of eyes, using retinoscope.
- Conduct visual field tests to measure field of vision.
- Measure corneal thickness, using pachymeter or contact ultrasound methods.
- Measure corneal curvature with keratometers or ophthalmometers to aid in the diagnosis of conditions, such as astigmatism.
- Supervise or instruct ophthalmic staff.
- Measure the thickness of the retinal nerve, using scanning laser polarimetry techniques to aid in diagnosis of glaucoma.
- Assist physicians in performing ophthalmic procedures, including surgery.
- Perform fluorescein angiography of the eye.
- Photograph patients' eye areas, using clinical photography techniques, to document retinal or corneal defects.
- Maintain ophthalmic instruments or equipment.
- Conduct tests, such as the Amsler Grid test, to measure central visual field used in the early diagnosis of macular degeneration, glaucoma, or diseases of the eye.
- Conduct binocular disparity tests to assess depth perception.
- Assess abnormalities of color vision, such as amblyopia.
- Call patients to inquire about their post-operative status or recovery.
- Instruct patients in the care and use of contact lenses.
- Conduct low vision blindness tests.
- Perform advanced ophthalmic procedures, including electrophysiological, electrophysical, or microbial procedures.
- Perform slit lamp biomicroscopy procedures to diagnose disorders of the eye, such as retinitis, presbyopia, cataracts, or retinal detachment.
- Create three-dimensional images of the eye, using computed tomography (CT).
