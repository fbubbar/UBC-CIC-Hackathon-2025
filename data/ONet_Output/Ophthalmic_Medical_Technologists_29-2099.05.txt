- Conduct ocular motility tests to measure function of eye muscles.
- Assess refractive condition of eyes, using retinoscope.
- Conduct visual field tests to measure field of vision.
- Measure corneal thickness, using pachymeter or contact ultrasound methods.
- Measure corneal curvature with keratometers or ophthalmometers to aid in the diagnosis of conditions, such as astigmatism.
- Supervise or instruct ophthalmic staff.
- Measure the thickness of the retinal nerve, using scanning laser polarimetry techniques to aid in diagnosis of glaucoma.
- Assist physicians in performing ophthalmic procedures, including surgery.
- Perform fluorescein angiography of the eye.
