- Measure and assess vegetation resources for biological assessment companies, environmental impact statements, and rangeland monitoring programs.
- Maintain soil stability and vegetation for non-grazing uses, such as wildlife habitats and outdoor recreation.
- Study grazing patterns to determine number and kind of livestock that can be most profitably grazed and to determine the best grazing seasons.
- Offer advice to rangeland users on water management, forage production methods, and control of brush.
- Plan and direct construction and maintenance of range improvements, such as fencing, corrals, stock-watering reservoirs, and soil-erosion control structures.
- Mediate agreements among rangeland users and preservationists as to appropriate land use and management.
- Study rangeland management practices and research range problems to provide sustained production of forage, livestock, and wildlife.
