- Provide advice on proper standards and regulations or the development of policies, strategies, or codes of practice for environmental management.
- Prepare charts or graphs from data samples, providing summary information on the environmental relevance of the data.
- Research sources of pollution to determine their effects on the environment and to develop theories or methods of pollution abatement or control.
- Supervise or train students, environmental technologists, technicians, or other related staff.
- Monitor environmental impacts of development activities.
- Evaluate violations or problems discovered during inspections to determine appropriate regulatory actions or to provide advice on the development and prosecution of regulatory cases.
