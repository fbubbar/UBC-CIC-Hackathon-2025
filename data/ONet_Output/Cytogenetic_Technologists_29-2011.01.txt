Job Title: Cytogenetic Technologists
O*NET-SOC Code: 29-2011.01

# DESCRIPTION
Analyze chromosomes or chromosome segments found in biological specimens, such as amniotic fluids, bone marrow, solid tumors, and blood to aid in the study, diagnosis, classification, or treatment of inherited or acquired genetic diseases. Conduct analyses through classical cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) techniques.

# TASKS
- Arrange and attach chromosomes in numbered pairs on karyotype charts, using standard genetics laboratory practices and nomenclature, to identify normal or abnormal chromosomes.
- Count numbers of chromosomes and identify the structural abnormalities by viewing culture slides through microscopes, light microscopes, or photomicroscopes.
- Examine chromosomes found in biological specimens to detect abnormalities.
- Apply prepared specimen and control to appropriate grid, run instrumentation, and produce analyzable results.
- Select appropriate culturing system or procedure based on specimen type and reason for referral.
- Analyze chromosomes found in biological specimens to aid diagnoses and treatments for genetic diseases such as congenital disabilities, fertility problems, and hematological disorders.
- Harvest cell cultures using substances such as mitotic arrestants, cell releasing agents, and cell fixatives.
- Summarize test results and report to appropriate authorities.
- Prepare biological specimens such as amniotic fluids, bone marrow, tumors, chorionic villi, and blood, for chromosome examinations.
- Select or prepare specimens and media for cell cultures using aseptic techniques, knowledge of medium components, or cell nutritional requirements.
- Input details of specimen processing, analysis, and technical issues into logs or laboratory information systems (LIS).
- Prepare slides of cell cultures following standard procedures.
- Input details of specimens into logs or computer systems.
- Select appropriate methods of preparation and storage of media to maintain potential of hydrogen (pH), sterility, or ability to support growth.
- Develop, implement, and monitor quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure accurate and precise test performance and reports.
- Stain slides to make chromosomes visible for microscopy.
- Describe chromosome, FISH and aCGH analysis results in International System of Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) language.
- Evaluate appropriateness of received specimens for requested tests.
- Create chromosome images using computer imaging systems.
- Recognize and report abnormalities in the color, size, shape, composition, or pattern of cells.
- Determine optimal time sequences and methods for manual or robotic cell harvests.
- Communicate to responsible parties unacceptable specimens and suggest remediation for future submissions.
- Select banding methods to permit identification of chromosome pairs.
- Maintain laboratory equipment such as photomicroscopes, inverted microscopes, and standard darkroom equipment.
- Identify appropriate methods of specimen collection, preservation, or transport.
- Archive case documentation and study materials as required by regulations and laws.
- Supervise subordinate laboratory staff.
- Develop and implement training programs for trainees, medical students, resident physicians or post-doctoral fellows.
- Communicate test results or technical information to patients, physicians, family members, or researchers.
- Extract, measure, dilute as appropriate, label, and prepare DNA for array analysis.
