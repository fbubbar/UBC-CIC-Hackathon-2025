# TASKS
- Set up, operate, or tend machines that extrude and form filaments from synthetic materials such as rayon, fiberglass, or liquid polymers.
- Press buttons to stop machines when processes are complete or when malfunctions are detected.
- Notify other workers of defects, and direct them to adjust extruding and forming machines.
- Observe machine operations, control boards, and gauges to detect malfunctions such as clogged bushings and defective binder applicators.
- Load materials into extruding and forming machines, using hand tools, and adjust feed mechanisms to set feed rates.
- Move controls to activate and adjust extruding and forming machines.
- Record details of machine malfunctions.
- Clean and maintain extruding and forming machines, using hand tools.
- Observe flow of finish across finish rollers, and turn valves to adjust flow to specifications.
- Remove polymer deposits from spinnerettes and equipment, using silicone spray, brass chisels, and bronze-wool pads.
- Press metering-pump buttons and turn valves to stop flow of polymers.
- Record operational data on tags, and attach tags to machines.
- Start metering pumps and observe operation of machines and equipment to ensure continuous flow of filaments extruded through spinnerettes and to detect processing defects.
- Remove excess, entangled, or completed filaments from machines, using hand tools.
- Wipe finish rollers with cloths and wash finish trays with water when necessary.
- Lower pans inside cabinets to catch molten filaments until flow of polymer through packs has stopped.
- Open cabinet doors to cut multifilament threadlines away from guides, using scissors.
