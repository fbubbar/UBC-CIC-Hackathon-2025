Job Title: Neurodiagnostic Technologists
O*NET-SOC Code: 29-2099.01

# DESCRIPTION
Conduct electroneurodiagnostic (END) tests such as electroencephalograms, evoked potentials, polysomnograms, or electronystagmograms. May perform nerve conduction studies.

# TASKS
- Indicate artifacts or interferences derived from sources outside of the brain, such as poor electrode contact or patient movement, on electroneurodiagnostic recordings.
- Monitor patients during tests or surgeries, using electroencephalographs (EEG), evoked potential (EP) instruments, or video recording equipment.
- Conduct tests or studies such as electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography (PSG), nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), and intraoperative monitoring (IOM).
- Collect patients' medical information needed to customize tests.
- Explain testing procedures to patients, answering questions or reassuring patients, as needed.
- Set up, program, or record montages or electrical combinations when testing peripheral nerve, spinal cord, subcortical, or cortical responses.
- Summarize technical data to assist physicians to diagnose brain, sleep, or nervous system disorders.
- Conduct tests to determine cerebral death, the absence of brain activity, or the probability of recovery from a coma.
- Attach electrodes to patients, using adhesives.
- Measure patients' body parts and mark locations where electrodes are to be placed.
- Submit reports to physicians summarizing test results.
- Calibrate, troubleshoot, or repair equipment and correct malfunctions, as needed.
- Adjust equipment to optimize viewing of the nervous system.
- Measure visual, auditory, or somatosensory evoked potentials (EPs) to determine responses to stimuli.
- Assist in training technicians, medical students, residents, or other staff members.
- Participate in research projects, conferences, or technical meetings.
