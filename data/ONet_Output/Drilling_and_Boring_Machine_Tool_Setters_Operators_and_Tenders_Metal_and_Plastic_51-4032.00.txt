Job Title: Drilling and Boring Machine Tool Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic
O*NET-SOC Code: 51-4032.00

# DESCRIPTION
Set up, operate, or tend drilling machines to drill, bore, ream, mill, or countersink metal or plastic work pieces.

# TASKS
- Verify conformance of machined work to specifications, using measuring instruments, such as calipers, micrometers, or fixed or telescoping gauges.
- Study machining instructions, job orders, or blueprints to determine dimensional or finish specifications, sequences of operations, setups, or tooling requirements.
- Move machine controls to lower tools to workpieces and to engage automatic feeds.
- Verify that workpiece reference lines are parallel to the axis of table rotation, using dial indicators mounted in spindles.
- Establish zero reference points on workpieces, such as at the intersections of two edges or over hole locations.
- Change worn cutting tools, using wrenches.
- Select and set cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cuts, and cutting tools, according to machining instructions or knowledge of metal properties.
- Position and secure workpieces on tables, using bolts, jigs, clamps, shims, or other holding devices.
- Observe drilling or boring machine operations to detect any problems.
- Lift workpieces onto work tables either manually or with hoists or direct crane operators to lift and position workpieces.
- Turn valves and direct flow of coolants or cutting oil over cutting areas.
- Install tools in spindles.
- Perform minor assembly, such as fastening parts with nuts, bolts, or screws, using power tools or hand tools.
- Operate single- or multiple-spindle drill presses to bore holes so that machining operations can be performed on metal or plastic workpieces.
- Lay out reference lines and machining locations on work, using layout tools, and applying knowledge of shop math and layout techniques.
- Sharpen cutting tools, using bench grinders.
- Operate tracing attachments to duplicate contours from templates or models.
