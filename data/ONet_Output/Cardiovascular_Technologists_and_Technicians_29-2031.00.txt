- Observe ultrasound display screen and listen to signals to record vascular information, such as blood pressure, limb volume changes, oxygen saturation, or cerebral circulation.
- Assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac or peripheral vascular treatments, such as implanting pacemakers or assisting with balloon angioplasties to treat blood vessel blockages.
- Assess cardiac physiology and calculate valve areas from blood flow velocity measurements.
- Operate diagnostic imaging equipment to produce contrast enhanced radiographs of heart and cardiovascular system.
