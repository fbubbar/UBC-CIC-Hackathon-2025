- Place and install screens, casings, pumps, and other well fixtures to develop wells.
- Operate water-well drilling rigs and other equipment to drill, bore, and dig for water wells or for environmental assessment purposes.
- Review client requirements and proposed locations for drilling operations to determine feasibility, and to determine cost estimates.
- Drill or bore holes in rock for blasting, grouting, anchoring, or building foundations.
- Perform pumping tests to assess well performance.
- Disinfect, reconstruct, and redevelop contaminated wells and water pumping systems, and clean and disinfect new wells in preparation for use.
- Design well pumping systems.
- Signal crane operators to move equipment.
- Withdraw drill rods from holes, and extract core samples.
- Inspect core samples to determine nature of strata, or take samples to laboratories for analysis.
