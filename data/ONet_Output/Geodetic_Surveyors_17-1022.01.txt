Job Title: Geodetic Surveyors
O*NET-SOC Code: 17-1022.01

# DESCRIPTION
Measure large areas of the Earth's surface using satellite observations, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), light detection and ranging (LIDAR), or related sources.

# TASKS
- Analyze control or survey data to ensure adherence to project specifications or land survey standards.
- Conduct surveys to determine exact positions, measurement of points, elevations, lines, areas, volumes, contours, or other features of land surfaces.
- Calculate the exact horizontal and vertical position of points on the Earth's surface.
- Maintain databases of geodetic and related information, including coordinate, descriptive, or quality assurance data.
- Verify the mathematical correctness of newly collected survey data.
- Compute horizontal and vertical coordinates of control networks, using direct leveling or other geodetic survey techniques, such as triangulation, trilateration, and traversing, to establish features of the Earth's surface.
- Plan or direct the work of geodetic surveying staff, providing technical consultation as needed.
- Assess the quality of control data to determine the need for additional survey data for engineering, construction, or other projects.
- Distribute compiled geodetic data to government agencies or the general public.
- Request additional survey data when field collection errors occur or engineering surveying specifications are not maintained.
- Read current literature, talk with colleagues, continue education, or participate in professional organizations or conferences to keep abreast of developments in technology, equipment, or systems.
- Provide training and interpretation in the use of methods or procedures for observing and checking controls for geodetic and plane coordinates.
- Prepare progress or technical reports.
- Review existing standards, controls, or equipment used, recommending changes or upgrades as needed.
- Compute, retrace, or adjust existing surveys of features such as highway alignments, property boundaries, utilities, control and other surveys to match the ground elevation-dependent grids, geodetic grids, or property boundaries and to ensure accuracy and continuity of data used in engineering, surveying, or construction projects.
- Determine orientation of tracts of land, including position, boundaries, size, and shape, using theodolites, electronic distance-measuring equipment, satellite-based positioning equipment, land information systems, or other geodetic survey equipment.
