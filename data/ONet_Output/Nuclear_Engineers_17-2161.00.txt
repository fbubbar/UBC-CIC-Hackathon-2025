- Design fuel cycle models or processes to reduce the quantity of radioactive waste generated from nuclear activities.
- Consult with other scientists to determine parameters of experimentation or suitability of analytical models.
- Recommend preventive measures to be taken in the handling of nuclear technology, based on data obtained from operations monitoring or from evaluation of test results.
- Discuss construction project proposals with interested parties, such as vendors, contractors, or nuclear facility review boards.
- Perform experiments that will provide information about acceptable methods of nuclear material usage, nuclear fuel reclamation, or waste disposal.
- Conduct environmental studies on topics such as nuclear power generation, nuclear waste disposal, or nuclear weapon deployment.
- Design or direct nuclear research projects to develop, test, modify, or discover new uses for theoretical models.
- Keep abreast of developments and changes in the nuclear field by reading technical journals or by independent study and research.
