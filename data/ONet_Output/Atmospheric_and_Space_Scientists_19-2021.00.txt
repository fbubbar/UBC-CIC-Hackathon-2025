- Prepare weather reports or maps for analysis, distribution, or use in weather broadcasts, using computer graphics.
- Develop and deliver training on weather topics.
- Prepare scientific atmospheric or climate reports, articles, or texts.
- Analyze climate data sets, using techniques such as geophysical fluid dynamics, data assimilation, or numerical modeling.
- Analyze historical climate information, such as precipitation or temperature records, to help predict future weather or climate trends.
- Consult with other offices, agencies, professionals, or researchers regarding the use and interpretation of climatological information for weather predictions and warnings.
- Speak to the public to discuss weather topics or answer questions.
- Apply meteorological knowledge to issues such as global warming, pollution control, or ozone depletion.
- Perform managerial duties, such as creating work schedules, creating or implementing staff training, matching staff expertise to situations, or analyzing performance of offices.
- Measure wind, temperature, and humidity in the upper atmosphere, using weather balloons.
- Direct forecasting services at weather stations or at radio or television broadcasting facilities.
- Collect air samples from planes or ships over land or sea to study atmospheric composition.
- Teach college-level courses on topics such as atmospheric and space science, meteorology, or global climate change.
- Design or develop new equipment or methods for meteorological data collection, remote sensing, or related applications.
- Research the impact of industrial projects or pollution on climate, air quality, or weather phenomena.
- Conduct wind assessment, integration, or validation studies.
- Conduct numerical simulations of climate conditions to understand and predict global or regional weather patterns.
- Estimate or predict the effects of global warming over time for specific geographic regions.
- Create visualizations to illustrate historical or future changes in the Earth's climate, using paleoclimate or climate geographic information systems (GIS) databases.
