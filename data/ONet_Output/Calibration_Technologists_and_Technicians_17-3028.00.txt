Determine measurement standard suitability for calibrating measurement devices. May perform preventive maintenance on equipment. May perform corrective actions to address identified calibration problems.

# TASKS
- Analyze test data to identify defects or determine calibration requirements.
- Attend conferences, workshops, or other training sessions to learn about new tools or methods.
- Calibrate devices by comparing measurements of pressure, temperature, humidity, or other environmental conditions to known standards.
- Conduct calibration tests to determine performance or reliability of mechanical, structural, or electromechanical equipment.
- Develop new calibration methods or techniques based on measurement science, analyses, or calibration requirements.
- Disassemble and reassemble equipment for inspection.
- Draw plans for developing jigs, fixtures, instruments, or other devices.
- Maintain or repair measurement devices or equipment used for calibration testing.
- Operate metalworking machines to fabricate housings, jigs, fittings, or fixtures.
- Order replacement parts for malfunctioning equipment.
- Plan sequences of calibration tests according to equipment specifications and scientific principles.
- Read blueprints, schematics, diagrams, or technical orders.
- Verify part dimensions or clearances using precision measuring instruments to ensure conformance to specifications.
- Visually inspect equipment to detect surface defects.
- Write and submit reports about the results of calibration tests.
