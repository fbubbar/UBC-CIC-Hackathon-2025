- Stop machines to remove finished workpieces or to change tooling, setup, or workpiece placement, according to required machining sequences.
- Listen to machines during operation to detect sounds such as those made by dull cutting tools or excessive vibration, and adjust machines to compensate for problems.
- Implement changes to machine programs, and enter new specifications, using computers.
- Calculate machine speed and feed ratios and the size and position of cuts.
- Transfer commands from servers to computer numerical control (CNC) modules, using computer network links.
- Remove and replace dull cutting tools.
- Check to ensure that workpieces are properly lubricated and cooled during machine operation.
- Adjust machine feed and speed, change cutting tools, or adjust machine controls when automatic programming is faulty or if machines malfunction.
- Monitor machine operation and control panel displays, and compare readings to specifications to detect malfunctions.
- Maintain machines and remove and replace broken or worn machine tools, using hand tools.
- Insert control instructions into machine control units to start operation.
- Modify cutting programs to account for problems encountered during operation, and save modified programs.
- Write simple programs for computer-controlled machine tools.
- Lift workpieces to machines manually or with hoists or cranes.
- Input initial part dimensions into machine control panels.
- Set up future jobs while machines are operating.
- Confer with supervisors or programmers to resolve machine malfunctions or production errors or to obtain approval to continue production.
- Stack or load finished items, or place items on conveyor systems.
- Control coolant systems.
- Clean machines, tooling, or parts, using solvents or solutions and rags.
